ACCESS-NRI Model Diagnostics documentation
=============================================
Welcome to the documentation and reference guide for the `ACCESS-NRI <https://www.access-nri.org.au/>`_ Model Live Diagnostics package. The Model Live Diagnostics framework is designed to provide useful and practical Jupyter-based tools for the monitoring and diagnostic analyses of currently running (i.e. 'live') ACCESS climate models on the Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi.

This documentation aims to introduce these new tools, and support both new and existing users to get the most out of them using the Australia Research Environment (ARE).

The ACCESS-NRI Model Live Diagnostics package, and the tools that support it, are still a work in progress. We value your feedback, especially in the form of reporting issues/bugs or suggesting ways to improve the framework. To do so, please open an issue `here <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/MED-live-diagnostics/issues>`_.
