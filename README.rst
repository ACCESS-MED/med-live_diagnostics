Live model diagnostics.
=========================

**Framework for monitoring and diagnostic analyses of the ACCESS model suite.**

The Model Live Diagnostics framework is designed to provide useful and practical Jupyter-based tools for the monitoring and diagnostic 
analyses of currently running (aka 'live') ACCESS climate models on the Australian NCI supercomputer Gadi.

The ACCESS-NRI Model Live Diagnostics package, and the tools that support it, are still a work in progress. We value your feedback, 
especially in the form of reporting issues/bugs or suggesting ways to improve the framework. To do so, please open an 
`issue <https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/MED-live-diagnostics/issues>`_.

The full documentation is available from `readthedocs <https://med-live-diagnostics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
